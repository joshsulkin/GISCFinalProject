# GISC Final Project: Digitized Diplomat

Welcome to my final project for the GIScience minor. Please view "GISC284_JLS_FinalProject.Rmd" for a demonstration of the project.

# Introduction

Roger Peyrefitte (1907—2000) is best known as an author of the award-winning book, "Les Amitiés Particulières" (1943), which revealed then-shocking revelations of homosexuality in his childhood that riled up wartime French society. Yet, his popularity is waning today as an author, and whatever name recognition he receives is mostly limited to France. What's more, he was much more than an author and his prior career is virtually forgotten.

In 1931, Roger Peyrefitte, age 24, was hired by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to serve as a diplomat. He experimented with his homosexuality particularly while serving at the French Embassy in Athens. Yet his career was cut short (twice!) due to his homosexuality. After the post-Vichy government fired him for a final time, he challenged the French government in public by suing for his discriminatory firing and pursuing his famous writing career. In particular, Peyrefitte’s "Les Ambassades" took the world by storm in 1951. Sparking a “Scandal in the Quai d’Orsay,” "Les Ambassades" publicized extensive homosexual affairs in the highest echelons of power in embassies across Athens and throughout the French government. Speaking truth (or perhaps rumors) to power, Peyrefitte was a pivotal, but obfuscated, part of early twentieth century reckonings with homophobia in French society. His diplomatic and writing careers fundamentally demonstrated that the battle to control sexuality has a global and deep history that continues to effect the ways that countries and people interact today.

Peyrefitte's early diplomatic and literary journeys—until he was fired in 1945—are the subject of the digitized map below.

# Accessible Viewing of Pop-Up Descriptions

To view the descriptions of the pop-ups in a visually accessible format and in chronological order, please see below.

### Destination 1: Paris, France [7/25/1931 – 5/31/1933] 

Peyrefitte was hired by the Ministère des Affaires Étrangères (Ministry of Foreign Affairs) on July 25, 1931 after graduating first in his class from Institut d'Études Politiques de Paris.

### Destination 2: Athens, Greece [5/31/1933 – 11/30/1937]

For over four years, Peyrefitte worked as Embassy Secretary at the French Embassy in Athens, Greece. The Ministry asked him repeatedly to switch to a different post (more than once he was asked to go to China), but Peyrefitte fought to remain in the "mythological atmosphere" and "freedom" of Athens that he felt did not exist anywhere else in the world. Emboldened by his diplomatic immunity, he explored his homosexuality in Athens. However, a heavily publicized embassy sex scandal forced Peyrefitte to return to Paris for reassignment.

### Destination 3: Paris, France [12/1/1937 – 5/31/1940]

After the embassy scandal in Greece, Peyrefitte went back to Paris and was reassigned by the Manager of Personnel, M. de Robien. He began working at the Ministry's subdepartment of Services des œuvres françaises à l’étranger (French Works Abroad), where he served as a censor. He worked in both Tours and Paris in this position, but stayed mostly in Paris during this period before the Nazis took over and installed the Vichy regime.

### Destination 4: Tours, France [6/1/1940 – 9/30/1940]

Peyrefitte worked back and forth in Paris and Tours while he served in the French Works Abroad subdepartment.

### Destination 5: Paris, France [10/1/1940 – 10/9/1940]

Peyrefitte briefly visited Paris before discovering that his father was on his deathbed and that he would need to comfort his mother, so he prepared his affairs to travel to Aude, France.

### Destination 6: Vichy, France [10/10/1940 – 10/13/1940]

On his way to visit his dying father, he stopped in Vichy for what the remaining documents indicate was supposed to be a simple rest stop and possibly a planned trip to the new center of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. However, Peyrefitte allegedly solicited a teenage boy according to a police report. After this was sent to the Ministry in Vichy, the hiring manager pressured Peyrefitte into voluntarily resigning instead of suffering from a public firing that would have essentially "outted" him, including to his family.

### Destination 7: Aude, France [10/14/1940 – 10/31/1940]

Peyrefitte comforted his mother after his father died. Around this time, Peyrefitte began working on his first novel and decided to travel to different areas in France to catch up with his childhood friends and write.

### Destination 8: Toulouse, France [11/1/1940 – 11/14/1940]

In Toulouse, Peyrefitte visited some of his childhood friends while he was doing research for his first novel, "Les Amitiés Particulières."

### Destination 9: Nice, France [11/15/1940 – 11/19/1940]

Peyrefitte vacationed in Nice and may have visited additional childhood friends to further deepen his research.

### Destination 10: Marseille, France [11/20/1940 – 12/31/1940]

In Marseille, Peyrefitte visited some of his childhood friends while he was doing research for his novel.

### Destination 11: Toulouse, France [1/1/1941 – 4/30/1943]

Peyrefitte finished writing his first novel while staying with his childhood friends and corresponded with Flammarion, his publisher. He also corresponded with M. de Robien to plead for his job back after his extremely popular novel publicized his homosexuality. Although still unclear from the remaining evidence, Peyrefitte's case caught the attention of the German Ambassador to France and the upper echelons of power in Germany and Vichy France, which forcefully advocated for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to reinstate him. Just days after that request in 1943, the Ministry asked Peyrefitte to return to Paris for rehiring.

### Destination 12: Paris, France [5/1/1943 – 2/24/1945]

With the German Embassy advocating for Peyrefitte's reinstatement, Peyrefitte returned to Paris to resume work in the Ministry. This time, he worked in the Bureau des rapatriements (Office of Repatriation) to transfer French and German prisoners of war between the two countries. In some documents, Peyrefitte claims to have left his post in August 1944 when the Vichy state was dissolved following D-Day. Yet he was still technically an employee of the Ministry until February 24, 1945, when the Commission d'Épuration (Purge Committee) fired Peyrefitte without providing an explicit reason, but it is extremely clear from the circumstances that it was because of his homosexuality since many other bureaucrats remained employed despite their collaboration.

# Limitations

I personally gathered all of the data used in the maps using documents from the Archives Diplomatiques, Peyrefitte's personal archives, his novels, and other primary sources. I used the dates for whatever had a preponderance of evidence and fit across as many sources as possible. While I mostly privileged government documents when it was not entirely clear of the exact date (e.g., his departure from Greece), I tried to compare the dates across Peyrefitte’s personal writings, his friends’ writings, the government’s records, and newspaper evidence when possible. At times, the sources I used may have said “late 1940” or use another vague temporal qualifier. In those circumstances, I had to estimate the date, so I used the 30th of a given month if it was “late April,” for example.

Another assumption that I made was that I ignored the time it would have taken the diplomats to travel between destinations. Although in very few cases the sources I used may have mentioned how long it took the diplomats to travel, I wanted to remain as consistent as possible across the timelines since there were only very few cases in which travel time was recorded.

# Acknowledgements

The sources I used to collect the data for this map came from many locations, mostly the Archives Diplomatiques in La Courneuve, France. The digitized map was based on a static map that I received extended assistance from Dr. Crystal Bae. This digitizied map would not have been possible without help from Dr. Luc Anselin and Dr. Bae. I thank everyone involved in this process for assisting me in shedding light onto such an important and understudied figure in diplomatic, LGBT+, French, and literature history.
