# GISC Final Project: Digitized Diplomat

Welcome to my final project for the GIScience minor. Please view "GISC284_JLS_FinalProject.Rmd" for a demonstration of the project.

# Introduction

Roger Peyrefitte (1907—2000) is best known as an author of the award-winning book, "Les Amitiés Particulières" (1943), which revealed then-shocking revelations of homosexuality in his childhood that riled up wartime French society. Yet, his popularity is waning today as an author, and whatever name recognition he receives is mostly limited to France. What's more, he was much more than an author and his prior career is virtually forgotten.

In 1931, Roger Peyrefitte, age 24, was hired by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to serve as a diplomat. He experimented with his homosexuality particularly while serving at the French Embassy in Athens. Yet his career was cut short (twice!) due to his homosexuality. After the post-Vichy government fired him for a final time, he challenged the French government in public by suing for his discriminatory firing and pursuing his famous writing career. In particular, Peyrefitte’s "Les Ambassades" took the world by storm in 1951. Sparking a “Scandal in the Quai d’Orsay,” "Les Ambassades" publicized extensive homosexual affairs in the highest echelons of power in embassies across Athens and throughout the French government. Speaking truth (or perhaps rumors) to power, Peyrefitte was a pivotal, but obfuscated, part of early twentieth century reckonings with homophobia in French society. His diplomatic and writing careers fundamentally demonstrated that the battle to control sexuality has a global and deep history that continues to effect the ways that countries and people interact today.

Peyrefitte's early diplomatic and literary journeys—until he was fired in 1945—are the subject of the digitized map below.
